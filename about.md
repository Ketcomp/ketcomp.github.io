Hey there! My name is Gaurav Ketkar.

This blog/diary has been several years in the making - not that _that_ means I have been
_actually_ working on the blog for many years, mind you! The idea of a blog always came to me during critical times - a day before an important exam or more recently in the middle of an exhausting work week, but when I actually had the time on my hands, I always ended up watching re-runs of FRIENDS for the umpteenth time! Although I did post a couple of articles ([here](https://goo.gl/bdSdnm) and [here](https://goo.gl/y7nbA7)) on LinkedIn during by job-hunting days in hopes of grabbing the right eye-balls that was that and once I did manage to snag a position at IBM, that stopped. Besides LinkedIn doesn't feel like the right home for my personal thoughts.

Here I will posts write-ups about my various adventures and opinions on various things, book reviews, movie and music reviews, cooking recipes, about why I think software development mirrors the real world more closely than we think, why crowd-sourced software will bring about a real revolution in India, why offline road-trips are rad, how to use a $5 WiFi switch to get Google Assistant to turn your lights on and off when you say the magic words, "Lumos" and "Nox" and what not!

In the future, I also hope to revive interest in some of my dormant Github projects. Especially those that I think would really help people like this [resume scanning tool](https://goo.gl/kdbXxn) or this [welcome to usa](https://goo.gl/aT8SCn) repo for improvement and polish.

I will also have ocassional guest writers and invite posts especially from my talented sister who has a double Masters in journalism (Go Priyanka!). There is a comments section to every post. Do comment because I want to hear what you have to say!

Admittedly, many things in this 'About' write-up do not exist as of this writing, but they will be added in one by one - in true [Agile fashion](https://goo.gl/EsByYw)!
